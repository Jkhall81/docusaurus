# Fog Server

The [FOG Project](https://fogproject.org/) is an open-source application that allows one to install images through network / PXE booting. It is fairly old but still actively maintained. The project's github can be found [here](https://github.com/FOGProject/) if you are interested in looking at recent commits. The [FOG Wiki](https://wiki.fogproject.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) is where most of the project's documentation seems to be located.

This basically works exactly like Clonezilla without the need to use USB drives.
