# Final File

The Final file will, for the first step, be the file that you actually upload to blacklist alliance. During the entire blacklist process you need to keep three files intact, do not save over them: the Source, Final and DNC file.

## Naming Convention

This really only applies to the Source file. It uses the following naming convention `Source_SRC_Campaign_MM_DD_YYYY_#`. The first part 'Source' will always be the same. The SRC will be in the list delivery email along with the Campaign. The date needs to be in the Source file, and the last number will be a sequence number if the list is large and contains more than one file.

## Creating a Final File

Open up your Source file, delete every column except your phone number column. All you want in this file at first are the phone numbers. Rename the column header to "All". Now do Save As, make sure the file is being saved in .csv format, and replace the Source in the filename with Final. So the Final File format should be `Final_SRC_Campaign_MM_DD_YYYY_#`.
