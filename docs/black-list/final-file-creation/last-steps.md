# Email Report

Now that your files are prepared, find the email that the original list was delivered in. Reply all to it. Now paste your email report template into it, delete the stuff you don't need, and start filling in values. You will need to fill in values for total leads, total clean, invalid, no carrier, dnc, and fdnc (in multiple places).

Note that for FDNC and DNC values there are two sets of numbers:

```
2/2 DNC added to CK, 2/2 DNC added to BP of CK
1624/1734 FDNC added to CK and 1542/1734 FDNC added to BP of CK
```

The first number will be for the Vicidial portal upload, and the second for the BP upload. So the DNC and FDNC numbers will both be uploaded twice, once to vicidial and once to the backportal.

Once all your values, except for DNC, FDNC, invalid, and no carrier numbers uploaded, have been filled in on the email report, start uploading numbers. Remember invalid and no carrier numbers are only uploaded to the BP, and DNC and FDNC numbers are uploaded to both vicidial and the BP.

After your email report is complete, attach your DNC file to the email, and send it out. Lastly send the Final file to Rishi via Skype / Teams.
